    Plot depth profiles, overlaying the resulting traces on top of each other.

    Each input list is expected to be parallel and the same length. Each index represents one analysis condition across the lists.
    Using the same file for multiple conditions requires adding the same file multiple times, in the appropriate indices.

    This is the most flexible method for depth profile plotting. For most use cases, consider
    using one of the plot_depth_profile.by_* methods.

    TODO: I think it's reasonable for smoothing min_periods to be always set to 1 for this method, as it's a visualization tool, not quantitative. Is this unreasonable?
    TODO: Should the more restrictive meta versions allow *args, or only **kwargs?
    No, we want to be able to pass kwargs down to the line plotter, I think. Especially if we swap it out for one that takes more different standard args.
    TODO: It's mildly confusing that there are required args that are only seen as *args or **kwargs in the more restrictive meta versions... But this is so much cleaner...

        sample_names: list of names to use for labeling traces in the output; legend entries
        window_size: half-size of the desired window to plot; how far the window stretches on either side of the center point
        single_strand: True means we only grab counts from reads from the same strand as
            the region of interest, False means we always grab both strands within the regions
        regions_5to3prime: True means negative strand regions get flipped, False means no flipping
